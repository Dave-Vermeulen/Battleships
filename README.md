# Battleships ⚓🚢💣

This is my version of the classic game Battleships on 7x7 playing field. It was a project from the resource Head First Java by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates. the game is easy to play. It’s you against the computer, but unlike the real Battleship game, in this one you don’t place any ships of your own. Instead, your job is to sink the computer’s ships in the fewest number of guesses. Oh, and we aren’t sinking ships. We’re killing Dot Coms.

#### Goal: 
Sink all of the computer’s Dot Coms in the fewest number of guesses. You’re given a rating or level, based on how well you perform.Setup: When the game program is launched, the computer places three Dot Coms on a virtual 7 x 7 grid. When that’s complete, the game asks for your first guess. 
#### How you play: 
This version works at the command-line. The computer will prompt you to enter a guess (a cell), that you’ll type at the command-line as “A3”, “C5”, etc.). In response to your guess, you’ll see a result at the commandline, either “Hit”, “Miss”, or “You sunk Pets.com” (or whatever the lucky Dot Com of the day is). When you’ve sent all three Dot Coms to that big 404 in the sky, the game ends by printing out your rating.
